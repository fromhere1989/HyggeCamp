# HyggeCamp

Hellow! Here I'm learning how to work with React.js

This project is a clone of my friend's website - http://hyggecamp.ru/
that was build on Wix.

Next steps:
- Learn about server side rendering, to make this project isomorphic;
- Add form logic - to save guests data and questions;
- Create an admin panel;
- Make some styles;
- Learn how svg works;
